# MD5 Hash Generator

## Description
This script is a simple MD5 hash generator. It takes a string input from the user and produces the MD5 hash of that string. MD5 hashes are widely used for integrity checks, although they are not recommended for cryptographic security due to known vulnerabilities.

## Features
- Easy to use: Just run the script and input your string.
- Quick generation of MD5 hash.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
To use this script, clone the repository and run the Python file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pourjavadi/md5-hash-generator.git
cd md5-hash-generator
python md5_generator.py
```
Enter the string when prompted, and the script will display the MD5 hash.

## Disclaimer
